+Code the following app
+```
+Create a simple yet visually impressive mini app called **Tap Quest**, a fast 30-second tap game designed to look premium and be easy for any AI to extend. The app should feature a smooth Base-style gradient UI, a clean home screen with a start button, a game screen with a countdown timer and a large tappable button that increases the score, and an end screen that shows the final result and allows the user to save their best score onchain. Include an onchain leaderboard that displays the top players, and let the app auto-detect whether it is running as a Farcaster Frame or a regular web session. All tech decisions—frameworks, libraries, animations, UI enhancements, game logic improvements, onchain interactions, and deployment flow—should be chosen intelligently by the AI to ensure the mini app looks beautiful, feels smooth, and is easy to expand.
